        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping by!  This site will be a mash of musings, tutorials, code snippets, and various visual and audio uploads by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;#39;m working on an API and frontend that will eventually replace this website - and powering a few others.  This project is currently nicknamed Momoiro API (&amp;#39;pink&amp;#39; in Romaji).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other projects I&amp;#39;m working on include creating gameplay content (starting with KHOLAT, Amnesia, EVE Online and Star Wars - The Old Republic), recording some narration and a rendition of the Doctor Who theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This no doubt says quite a bit about me - that I&amp;#39;m something of a nerd... Which would be quite true.  I&amp;#39;m proud of it ;)&lt;/p&gt;
