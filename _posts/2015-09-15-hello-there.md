title: Hello there!

Thanks for dropping by!  This site will be a mash of musings, tutorials, code snippets, and various visual and audio uploads by myself.

Currently I'm working on an API and frontend that will eventually replace this website - and powering a few others.  This project is currently nicknamed Momoiro API ('pink' in Romaji).

Other projects I'm working on include creating gameplay content (starting with KHOLAT, Amnesia, EVE Online and Star Wars - The Old Republic), recording some narration and a rendition of the Doctor Who theme.

This no doubt says quite a bit about me - that I'm something of a nerd... Which would be quite true.  I'm proud of it ;)
