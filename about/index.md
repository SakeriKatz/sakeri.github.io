I'm Sakeri!  29 years old, living in Kent (United Kingdom).  I work as a freelancer programmer/developer (mostly web-based) and photographer by day.  By night I dabble in electronic music, writing/content curation, voice acting and gaming.

Programming-wise, I'm well versed with PHP, Perl, Python and ASP.  I also have experience (to a lesser extent) with ASP.NET (C# &amp; VB.NET), Java, LISP, Haskell and Ruby.

In the realm of photography, I use a PENTAX K-5 DSLR, though I've previously used Nikon and Canon DSLRs.  I also occasionally use a Chinon CE-4s SLR (Pentax K mount) for personal projects.  I hold a Certificate of Higher Education in Photography (Contemporary Practice) from the University for the Creative Arts.
